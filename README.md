# Tilevania
It's a 2D game. This game is quite similer to Super Mario game. Learned many new things while developping this game. Learned about Tilemap, new Animations, different Cameras etc. There are still so many bugs in this game which I coudn't fix. Created three interesting levels. Player get three lives to complete the levels. Losing a life won't reset the whole game, it will just restart from the last checkpoint.
